                        <h3> Sick of delivering pizza or working in a coffee shop? Want to throw axes for a living? </h3> Urban Axes Philadelphia is now looking for axe throwing coaches to lead group events at our new facility in East Kensington. If you're interested in an awesome job at Philly's coolest new indoor recreation venue, read on...
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Indoor competitive axe throwing has become a recreational and cultural juggernaut in Canada. Think darts but bigger and more satisfying. Urban Axes is excited to bring the first of its kind facility in the USA, right here in Philly. Our goals are simple: connect people in a casual social setting, build a culture around the sport of axe throwing and inspire a sense of community in a fun and safe environment.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>About Urban Axes: </h3>Urban Axes was founded in 2016 by a group of Australian and American friends who were inspired by the passion and popularity of axe throwing throughout the neighborhoods of Toronto, where thousands of people have experienced the thrill of throwing hatchets at one of the over a dozen facilities there.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Scheduled to open Summer 2016, Urban Axes Philadelphia will host both league play and group or private events - including birthdays, wedding parties, fun nights out, corporate team building and similar functions. Events are fully staffed in a private throwing area, with participants receiving individual coaching and target practice.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Urban Axes is currently looking to hire a staff of fun-loving, responsible coaches – and <b><u>THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE AT AXE THROWING NECESSARY OR EXPECTED</u></b> on the part of applicants!!!

                        <br/>
