                        <h3> Do I need to book or can I just come in? </h3> You definitely need to book ahead for group events. These are very popular particularly on Fri and Sat nights. We periodically offer walk-in throwing sessions during the week. Please look at our schedule to check availability. We are available for private events 7 days a week.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Can I really throw an axe?  Really?? </h3> You sure can, and once you land your first bullseye you will be hooked!
                        <hr/>
                        <h3> Will someone teach me how to do this? </h3> Of course! Our AXEpert coaches will be with you the whole time and will start with 1 on 1 lessons.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3> Am I allowed to bring alcohol? </h3> Yes we allow you to bring your own beer or wine but please no bottles. (OK with wine bottles are fine as long as you bring plastic cups). No hard liquor or cocktails please, save those for the post event drinks.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Do you have any food or drinks for sale?  Can we bring our own?   </h3> We have soft drinks, water, and limited snacks (chips, etc) available for sale. You are also welcome to bring your own (or have it delivered!)Please be sure to bring any plates/napkins/utensils you will need as well. No hard liquor or glass containers.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Isn’t this dangerous?? </h3> Great question and of course it is top of our mind as well. The format we use and the construction of the throwing lanes are all focused around the safety of the participants and spectators. Each competitor throws in their own individual lane and competes side by side with another competitor. For each pair of throwing competitors we have an event coordinator, we like to call them AXEperts, who are responsible for keeping score as well as safety supervision. Only the two active competitors throwing at that time are allowed within the throwing area, all other competitors and spectators are required to wait in the safety zone behind the lanes.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  What if I don’t have a group, how can I participate? </h3> Join one of our leagues! You don’t need a group to join the league. We will also periodically offer sessions for individuals wanting to throw an axe.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Is there an age limit? </h3> Yes we are currently limited to 21 and over. In the future we are looking into events for 18 and over.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  What do I wear? </h3> The only real requirement is for covered shoes, though it is helpful to have a shirt that allows you full range of motion for your arms. Other than that, it is pretty much up to you. If you want to wear a ball gown or your favorite track pants it’s up to you.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Is there parking? </h3> There is limited street parking available in the area so please consider ride sharing or other options such as Taxi’s, Uber, Lyft or Public Transport. Our location is easy to get to by all these options.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  How do I pay? </h3> We only accept credit card payments at this time. Cash payment is not available.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Do I need experience to join a league? </h3>No experience is required
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Do you allow spectators?</h3> Yes! There is no charge for spectators, but they will need to sign a waiver.
                        <hr/>
                        <h3>  Can we take pictures & videos? </h3> Definitely, you will want to remember your first bullseye. We’d also love for you to tag us on Instagram, Facebook and Tweet us!
                        <hr/>
                        <h3> What about accessibility? </h3> We may be in an old Philly warehouse but we have made sure the facility is fully ADA compliant with regards to access ramps, bathrooms and throwing facilities. Axe throwing is readily available for a wide range of people with different abilities.
